# Hi there!

My name is KeFeng and I am currently a Software Engineer at Gxxly ICC. My main job is responsible for the architecture design, infrastructure construction, and requirement implementation of the frontend business system on the cloud platform.

In my spare time, I enjoy outdoor activities such as short trips, camping (my favorite), hiking, and mountain climbing. And I will share these experiences in the **Lifestyle** section of the website.
